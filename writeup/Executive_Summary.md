# Executive Summary
(1–2 pages; fill in results once experiments finish)

**Problem:** Do tiny transformers learn a linear 'sum' feature mediating predictions on conservation tasks?

**Approach:** Train tiny transformer → linear probes for `s=x+y` → projection ablation → activation patching → invariance checks → baselines.

**Key Results:** (fill in numbers/plots)
